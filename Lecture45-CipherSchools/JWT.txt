JWT (JSON Web Token) in brief:

- JWT is a compact and self-contained token used for securely transmitting information between parties.
- It consists of three parts: header, payload, and signature.
- The header specifies the token type and signing algorithm.
- Payload contains data (claims) like user info and permissions.
- The signature is generated using a secret key or public/private key pair.
- JWT is stateless, reducing server-side storage needs.
- Commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications.
- Should be transmitted over HTTPS for security.
- Tokens can have expiration times.
- Widely used in Single Sign-On (SSO) systems and APIs.
- Validation involves verifying the signature and decoding the payload.
