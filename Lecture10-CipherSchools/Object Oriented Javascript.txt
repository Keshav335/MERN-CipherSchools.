A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method). For example: car, pen, bike, chair, glass, keyboard, monitor etc.
JavaScript is an object-based language. Everything is an object in JavaScript.
JavaScript is template based not class based. Here, we don't create class to get the object. But, we direct create objects.

There are 3 ways to create objects:
>By object literal
 The syntax of creating object using object literal:
 object={property1:value1,property2:value2.....propertyN:valueN}  

>By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)
 The syntax of creating object directly:
 var objectname=new Object();

>By using an object constructor (using new keyword)
<script>  
function emp(id,name,salary){  
this.id=id;  
this.name=name;  
this.salary=salary;  
}  
e=new emp(103,"Naruto Uzumaki",30000);    
document.write(e.id+" "+e.name+" "+e.salary);  
</script>
