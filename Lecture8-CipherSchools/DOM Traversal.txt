DOM traversal (also called walking or navigating the DOM) is the act of selecting nodes in the DOM tree from other nodes.

DOM traversing, which means “move through”, are used to “find” (or select) HTML elements based on their relation to other elements. 
Here traversing happen in both direction top to bottom or bottom to top. 
Start with one selection and move through that selection until you reach the elements you desire.
