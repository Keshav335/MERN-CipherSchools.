We can use MongoDB in two ways:
1.Access MongoDB in your own machine(download and install).

2.Free tear MongoDB database (Online) (For this we need to be connected with the internet).

a.Create Your MongoDB Account.
b.Sign in.
c.Select the Shered Option(which is free)(you can use AWS,Google Cloude,Azure acording to your choice).
d.AWS
e.Region: Mumbai
f.Click on create cluster button.
------------------
Now go to Network cluster:
->Add ip address: write 0.0.0.0(for the entire world)(but it is not the safe practice).

Now go to Your Database:
->load sample data.
->sample_geospatial(data base)
->Ship wrecks(collection/table)
->every row=record or document.
