SQL (Relational Databases) vs. NoSQL (Non-Relational Databases) Comparison:

SQL (Relational Databases):
1. Structure: Relational databases store data in tables with predefined schemas.
2. Schema: Strict, predefined schema is required, and all data must adhere to it.
3. Data Relationships: Relationships between tables are defined using foreign keys, ensuring data integrity.
4. Transactions: ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties guarantee data consistency.
5. Query Language: SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with the database and perform complex queries.
6. Scalability: Vertical scaling is common, achieved by upgrading hardware to handle increased loads.
7. Data Integrity: Ensured through relational constraints and the normalization process.
8. Suitable Use Cases: Recommended for applications with structured and well-defined data, such as financial systems and ERP solutions.

NoSQL (Non-Relational Databases):
1. Structure: NoSQL databases use various data models like document-based, key-value, column-family, or graph-based.
2. Schema: Schema flexibility allows for dynamic and unstructured data storage without a fixed schema.
3. Data Relationships: Relationships between data are either implicit or managed externally, with no strict constraints.
4. Transactions: NoSQL databases prioritize horizontal scalability and might sacrifice some ACID properties for better performance.
5. Query Language: NoSQL databases have specific query languages (e.g., MongoDB's BSON query language), but not standardized like SQL.
6. Scalability: Horizontal scaling is common, achieved by adding more servers to distribute the data and workload.
7. Data Integrity: While some NoSQL databases provide eventual consistency, others prioritize availability and partition tolerance over strong consistency.
8. Suitable Use Cases: Ideal for applications with rapidly changing data, unstructured data, or high-velocity data like social media, IoT, and real-time analytics.

Ultimately, the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of the application, data structure, scalability needs, and the complexity 
of queries. SQL databases excel in maintaining data integrity and handling complex queries, while NoSQL databases offer more flexibility and scalability for rapidly 
evolving applications and large-scale distributed systems.
