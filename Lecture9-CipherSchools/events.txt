Events are things that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so your code can react to them.

Events are fired inside the browser window, and tend to be attached to a specific item that resides in it. This might be a single element, a set of elements,
the HTML document loaded in the current tab, or the entire browser window. There are many different types of events that can occur.

For example:
The user selects, clicks, or hovers the cursor over a certain element.
The user chooses a key on the keyboard.
The user resizes or closes the browser window.
A web page finishes loading.
A form is submitted.
A video is played, paused, or ends.
An error occurs.
